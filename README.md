Welcome to the Netflix Clone project, created as part of a group effort to replicate the functionality and design of the popular Netflix streaming service. This project uses Next.js, ui.shadcn, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to simulate the Netflix interface and features. It’s a simple, yet effective way to understand how web development technologies work together to create dynamic websites.

The website replicates the look and feel of Netflix, with features such as a movie carousel, display of trending content, and a clean, responsive design. This project is a great learning tool for front-end developers and anyone interested in building web applications.
